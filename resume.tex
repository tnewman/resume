    {Detroit, MI}
    {November 2019 - Present}
    {
        \begin{cvitems}
            \item{Developed Spark applications and a custom Spark Structured Streaming Source to ingest vehicle data from Apache Pulsar into Hive, supporting millions of events per hour.}
            \item{
                Lead a team of developers to build several Spring Boot micro-services and Angular applications to support data collection for engineering and downstream OnStar applications. 
                The applications were deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and integrated with Kafka, Oracle, Redis, and S3.

    {March 2019 - November 2019}
    {
        \begin{cvitems}
            \item{Architected and implemented APIs in NodeJS based on feedback from designers, front-end developers, and product managers. The APIs used various AWS services (DynamoDB, RDS, S3, SQS, etc.).}
            \item{Architected and implemented next generation cloud infrastructure, including infrastructure as code (Terraform), containers (Docker and Kubernetes), and various AWS services (DynamoDB, RDS, S3, SQS, etc.). This effort significantly reduced site outages and simplified application deployments.}
            \item{Migrated legacy applications and infrastructure, including modifying applications to run in Docker, setting up Docker builds, and setting up CI pipelines.}

        \begin{cvitems}
            \item{Architected and wrote microservices in Python (Flask), JavaScript (NodeJS) and Java (Spring Boot) for REST and Pub/Sub-based APIs. The microservices integrated with DynamoDB, SNS, and SQS for a car sharing platform.}
            \item{Wrote a Python library for AWS SNS and SQS. This library allowed all Python microservices to benefit from multi-threaded queue subscriptions, greatly increasing performance.}
            \item{Architected and implemented cloud infrastructure, including infrastructure as code (Terraform), containers (Docker and Kubernetes), and various AWS services (DynamoDB, SNS, and SQS).}

    {
        \begin{cvitems}
            \item{Developed Java-based, multi-threaded application to ingest data into Hadoop with a maximum throughput of 20 gigabits per second. The minimum viable product was delivered 
                  3 months early.}
            \item{Developed a web-based data ingestion monitoring application using Spring Boot and Angular JS. The application was deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and provided the 
                  ability to support global ingestion sites from Dearborn.}
            \item{Lead a cross-functional team to improve native Hadoop data ingestion performance from Palo Alto, CA to Dearborn, MI. This project saved the company \$300,000 per year by 
                  eliminating the need to use a WAN accelerator.}
            \item{Implemented a CI/CD pipeline to allow the application to move from GitHub to the production PCF instance with no manual 
                  intervention required outside of GitHub.}
